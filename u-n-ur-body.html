      <h1>Workouts</h1>
      <h2>Dieting</h2>
      <p>The big one. Dieting, always the harder part when it comes to training. Yah, no, you can’t always eat whatever you want. Now dieting is a very big, depending on your, goal to make you achieve the image you want to portray. There are so many ways to diets, and different ways to diet, but I’m going to show the dieting 101 based of if you want to bulk, cut, or just eat healthier.</p>

      <h2>Lactose & Gluten Intolerant</h2>

      <h2>Vegan & Vegetarians</h2>

      <h2>Body Dysmorphia</h2>
      <p>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others. People of any age can have BDD, but it's most common in teenagers and young adults. It affects both men and women. Having BDD does not mean you're vain or self-obsessed. It can be very upsetting and have a big impact on your life. Body dysmorphia in body building and working out is affected a lot of people, so much so that it effects Mr. Olympia Chris Bumstead. Now it is a serious mental disorder as it can affect your training by making yourself not go, or not want or create other problems as insecurities, low self-esteem, and confidence. To get help with this, take picture of your progress to remind yourself how far you’ve gone, realise the secrets of social media and take breaks from it. And most importantly talk to people.</p>

      <h2>Women & The Menstrual Cycle</h2>
      <p>When it comes to working out, some things make it a lot harder for women. For instance, it is harder for women than men when it comes to fat loss. Women are usually smaller than men, and the smaller your body type the fewer calories your burn. (Ex: if you and your partner eat a sandwich it will maybe take you 60mins to burn it off and your partner 30mins, even though your meals were the same size). Men have the advantage to burn more calories in a shorter period. Therefore, there is some consideration when it comes to training if you are a woman or men you may have very different advantages and disadvantages.</p>
