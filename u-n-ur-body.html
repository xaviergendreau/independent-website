        <h2>Dieting</h2>
        <p>The big one. Dieting, always the harder part when it comes to training. Yah, no, you can’t always eat whatever you want. Now dieting is a very big, depending on your, goal to make you achieve the image you want to portray. There are so many ways to diets, and different ways to diet, but I’m going to show the dieting 101 based of if you want to bulk, cut, or just eat healthier.</p>
        <h2>Body Dysmorphia</h2>
        <p>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others. People of any age can have BDD, but it's most common in teenagers and young adults. It affects both men and women. Having BDD does not mean you're vain or self-obsessed. It can be very upsetting and have a big impact on your life. Body dysmorphia in body building and working out is affected a lot of people, so much so that it effects Mr. Olympia Chris Bumstead. Now it is a serious mental disorder as it can affect your training by making yourself not go, or not want or create other problems as insecurities, low self-esteem, and confidence. To get help with this, take picture of your progress to remind yourself how far you’ve gone, realise the secrets of social media and take breaks from it. And most importantly talk to people.</p>

        <h2>Lactose & Gluten Intolerants</h2>
        <h3>Lactose Intolerant</h3>
        <p>There’s a specific enzyme called Lactase which is necessary for our body to digest lactose. When our body doesn’t produce enough Lactase, lactose cannot be broken down as simple glucose, i.e., sugar. When the undigested lactose moves through the large intestine, the bacteria break down the lactose into acids and gases. This causes acute symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal cramps. Whey is known as the liquid part of milk when it’s separated from its solid position after the process of curdling. 100g of whey has 0.9g of protein.</p>
        <p>Whey protein contains necessary amino acids in an adequate amount, which helps in bodybuilding. This is why bodybuilders use whey protein and its supplements. Does the real question arise whether a lactose intolerant people should exclude dairy products from their diets completely? The answer is no. Dairy products are rich in nutrients necessary for the body. In such cases, one is to consult a doctor and only eat the dairy products allowed. A dairy product widely consumed in such conditions is complex and mature cheese as it lacks lactose.</p>

        <p>Our body has eleven amino acids and depends on us to obtain the remaining nine through the medium of food. People must consider taking in plant-based powders as an alternative. They prove to be very useful to provide the human body with the necessary nutrients that might lack one is unable to consume dairy products. Since this protein powder is purely natural, it is considered to be very healthy for the muscles.
          Since whey is derived from milk, people who are lactose intolerant may not use it. The actual amount of lactose in whey protein differs from product to product as they’re manufactured in three different kinds- whey concentrate, whey isolate, and whey hydrolysate. Whey isolate is more processed than whey concentrate and whey hydrolysate, containing less lactose than the
          Using whey isolate is a safer option for lactose-intolerant people, but there are better choices.</p>

          <h4>Here’s a list of alternatives to whey protein if you’re lactose intolerant.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Pea Protein</li>
            <li>Brown rice protein</li>
            <li>Soy protein</li>
            <li>Hemp protein</li>
            <li>Goat protein</li>
            <li>Egg white protein</li>

        <h2>Vegan & Vegetarians</h2>
        <p>For years, the conventional belief that ruled professional and amateur athletic training programs was that consuming meat was the only way to build muscle. Today, we know a balanced vegetarian diet that includes plant-based protein assists muscular development … no steak required. </p>
        <p>Well-planned vegetarian diets that meet energy needs and contain a variety of plant-based protein foods, such as soy products, beans, lentils, grains, nuts and seeds can provide adequate protein for athletes without the use of special foods or supplements. </p>
        <p>Athletes need to eat an appropriate amount of calories and a variety of protein foods throughout the day in order to meet their protein requirement. Amino acids make up the protein that our bodies need. Meat, eggs and dairy foods are typically the most coveted protein sources because they contain all nine essential amino acids in the ratios that humans require. Most sources of plant-based protein are lacking in at least one of the nine essential amino acids. Soy and quinoa are two exceptions. Including a variety of plant-based protein foods will ensure all of the essential amino acids are being consumed. Vegetarian athletes should include a quality source of protein with meals and snacks. Here are some tips for meeting protein needs without consuming meat: Eat five or six small meals per day that not only include a protein food, but also a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and plenty of water. More than half your calories each day should come from quality carbohydrates, which fuel your muscles. Choose heart healthy sources of fat, like olive oil, almonds, walnuts, avocados and canola oil. </p>

        <h2>Women & The Menstrual Cycle</h2>
        <p>When it comes to working out, some things make it a lot harder for women. For instance, it is harder for women than men when it comes to fat loss. Women are usually smaller than men, and the smaller your body type the fewer calories your burn. (Ex: if you and your partner eat a sandwich it will maybe take you 60mins to burn it off and your partner 30mins, even though your meals were the same size). Men have the advantage to burn more calories in a shorter period. Therefore, there is some consideration when it comes to training if you are a woman or men you may have very different advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the menstrual cycle, there are difference states that women will experience that men do not, because men have pretty much the same state when it comes to the reproduction status. Therefore, when it comes to fat loss for example, women go through stages, during the menstrual cycle (follicular phase and the luteal phase, ovulation, and menstruation). When the cycles are present there are peaks in performances and droughts with performances, moods, coordination, and strengths. These factors will make it more difficult for women when working out. So, to track your progress, let’s say you have 4 weeks in your cycle (even though you don’t have four weeks take this as reference) with your different phases you should take different measurements in each phase, ex: take measurements in the luteal phase, then in 4 weeks when you are back on your luteal phase take measurements and compare it to the first measurements of that phase and so on with the other phases. This is helpful because in different part of your cycle, your weight and strength stats can be very different in other parts of your cycle. To help, also, do an RPE (rate of perceived exhaustion). Determine how difficult the exercise is out of 10, because squatting 135lbs one week could be 6/10 and the other week 9/10, so take that with a grain of salt. In addition, during the cycle some women get cravings, for that it is recommend 3 piece of fruit a day because a women’s metabolism requirements of calories actually increase therefore you need to match that. It helps to know the reason of why you are starving is because you need more calorie intake than the other weeks. Also take into consideration there are good times too diet and bad times, so if you feel like the first 2 weeks of your cycle you feel comfortable in a calorie deficit (if you’re looking to lose weight) go to maintenance for the other 2, don’t feel like going to the gym maybe alternate with walking and most importantly don’t let other people physique and image dictate what your setting or your success looks like. Most importantly take it easy on yourself.</p>
