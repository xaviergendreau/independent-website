    <h2>Why Workout</h2>
    <p>So, you’re wondering what are the benefits of working out. I mean you clicked on this website for one reason or another other but all in all, it has to do with getting in shape or being more active. For starters, the most obvious reason and benefit of physical activity is weight management. If you want to gain strength and/or lose weight, exercise is undoubtedly number one on everyone’s list. For other health reasons besides helping obesity and overweight people, it also helps you relieve heart risk, the more you exercise the less your arteries and increases the blood flow even helping you with reducing your cancer chances. It also helps build muscle, hence making you stronger and helping your bones be stronger. It helps you in the long run as it makes you actually live longer. </p>
      <p>Still not ready to get off the couch?</p>
      <p>How about this? Working is actually a stimulant, it helps you boost the level of dopamine in your brain when working out, therefore it helps with depression and anxiety, and reduces your stress levels. It increases your self-confidence and self-esteem. Helps you sleep better and give you a brain boost… brain boost? You might ask, yes, working out indicate that creates new brain cells, a process called neurogenesis, and improve overall brain performance.</p>

    <div class="how-to-get-started">
    <h2>How To Get Started</h2>
    <p>To start working out it always seems like it’s an impossible task. I don't have enough time, I don’t know when to fit it in my your schedule, I don’t know any real workouts, I don’t have a plan, you think that it’s something that needs a specific start. And these are all excuses, they will do you no good, but “where do I start” you may probably be asking yourself, as you stare at your computer screen, and it’s easy. Just go. 95% of working out is getting to the gym or just starting your workout, after that the 5% left is just finishing the workout, small or big you’re in it, why do one exercise and leave? Exactly there’s is no point of doing that, you drove all the way there you’re going to finish your workout. After that everything will fall in place, you have a consistent schedule, diets and supplements will come after. And if you’re telling yourself, you don’t have time, it takes discipline to make time, it’s only 1-2 hours of your day. So, get up, and get to work.</p>

    <div class="the-golden-rules">
    <h2>The Golden Rules</h2>
    <p>So for whom it may concern, they’re little golden rules for working out that some people may overlook.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> It takes time! </li>
      <p>You want results immediately? Get plastic surgery. This is the number mistake that people make is they want results now, and it is said often enough that things take time but this one is worth the time and effort. You see so many benefits and you will create and image of your body that you desire most. If you don’t feel like working out either push through it, do little less that what you would normally and you will feel some type of accomplishment.  Sometimes you have a busy schedule, something might come up and you can’t go. Don’t stress thinking you lost all you progress, just get back into the next day or even next week but do not quit.</p>

      <li>Dieting!</li>
      <p>Now working out is half of the battle, yes dieting is a humongous part of your journey, all depending on what your goal is for ex:
        Bulking – You are not going very far in your bulk if you eat the Worlds Health Organisation’s requirements of daily food intake. You need to eat, and eat a lot and even more. Working out will get you in shape no doubt but if you want be a mass monster you need to fill your muscle with food
        Not all goals are the same therefore not all diets are the same</p>

        <li>Take a breather when u need it!</li>
        <p>It’s okay to ta a break, you’re not meant to workout 7 days a week for 2 hours, your not a pro yet, it’s okay to take a day off, rest and be in a better shape tomorrow than force a bad workout that can mess up your whole week.</p>

        <li>Track your progress</li>
        <p>Yes, cringy mirror selfies are not fun to take but they are good to give you a reference of your journey, it can keep you in check when being effected by something like body dysmorphia. Track your calories and whatnot so you know maybe why or not gaining or losing the weight you want to lose or gain.</p>

        <li>If it’s not for you, it’s not for you.</li>
        <p>Working out at the gym isn’t for everyone, but it is just one of many physical activities you can do to stay active. Go for a run, do full body workout at home, go hiking, go for walk, do a sport.</p>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="gym-rules">
      <h2>The Unwritten Rules of the Gym</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Don’t ego lift</li>
        <p>If you can’t lift it with good form don’t pick it up. Make sure when working out you use the weight you can do even though it’s little weight, everyone has to start somewhere, and you’ll get to heavy weights quicker than you think when starting low.</p>

        <li>Don’t slam the weight</li>
        <p>This is relating to ego lifting, if you have 1 plate on each side and your deadlifting it, don’t slam on the ground because u want everyone to look at you.</p>

        <li>Clean your Bench</li>
        <p>It’s a sanitary thing. Just do it. Your Sweat is gross.</p>

        <li>Respect Mirror Space</li>
        <p>If someone is obviously working in front of a mirror and getting a sick pump, don’t go in front of him, and if the equipment is there move it, or if can’t move it, move after your done your reps so he can look in the mirrors for his reps</p>

        <li>Don’t squad with the pad</li>
        <p>Just don’t. It’s made for hip thrust, not for your sensitive shoulders.</p>

        <li>Don’t stack little weight</li>
        <p>If you’re using a machine or a BB, don’t put 5 10lbs plate to make 50lbs, use a 45 and a 5.</p>

        ….and obviously

        <li>DON’T SKIP LEG DAY</li>
        <p>This one is self-explanatory, no one like an upside-down triangle.</p>
      </ol>
