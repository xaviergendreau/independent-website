    <h1>Workouts</h1>
    <h2>5 Day Split</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the workout pages where I will show you numerous exercises that can help you make your gym routine. To start off, the 5-day split is the classic five day a week workout plan. You choose what to do when, but it consists of Legs, Chest, Back, Arms and shoulders. It is possible to alternate however you want, if you like to do chest, switch it up with either glutes, or another leg day. Helpful tips I can give you when doing 5-day split, start with back, chest because the secondary muscles in those workouts are triceps and bicep, therefore doing arms at the start of your split will tire them and make your back and chest workout less efficient. Second of all, Legs and chest are your biggest muscle, so if you choose to take one out you work out replace it by the other.</p>

  <h2>3 Day Split</h2>
  <p>The 3-day split, this split consists of Push day, Pull day, and Legs day. This split works best for a busier schedule and to help gain a bit more mass since you’re doing less exercise so your consumption of food builds more of your body.</p>
  <p>Push = Chest + Triceps + Shoulders</p>
  <p>Pull = Back + Bicep + Shoulders</p>

  <h2>Body Weight Workouts</h2>
  <p>Body weight workouts, this self-explanatory, exercises that do not consider weight, so calisthenics and cardio. Very efficient there are no better nor worse than weight training. It is great for mobility and gaining strength that workouts with weight don’t create, also very good for starting and doing at home.</p>

  <h2>Spice It Up</h2>
  <p>Now you want to change it up, the workout is too boring. Easy there are simple things to accommodate your normal workout

<h3>Drop Set</h3>
<p>A drop set is an extended set of a move, usually performed as the last set of that exercise as a burnout. For example, for a seated dumbbell shoulder press, you’d do two sets of 10 to 12 reps using a certain weight. For your third set, you’d begin with the same weight and do as many reps as you can, then “drop” or reduce the weight and go to failure, and then drop the weight once more and rep out until you can’t lift the weight anymore.
“Drop sets are effective for an increasing volume of training while still maintaining good technique for muscle growth and fat loss”</p>

<h3>Superset</h3>
<p>Suppersetting is to perform two exercises in a row without break. A good example of a superset is skullcrushers: Try 10 reps (or roughly two to three reps from failure), and then without taking any break, transition into a close-grip bench press with the same weight until two to three reps from failure.
“First, they’re often used to drag a smaller muscle group into more fatigue and muscle damage under the assistance of a larger muscle group”</p>

<h3>Giant Set</h3>
<p>A giant set is a circuit of three or more moves for one body part performed one after another with little to no rest in between. For example, you might do an overhead press, a lateral raise, a rear-delt raise, and an upright row for shoulders — then rest a few minutes to catch your breath and repeat.
“Giant sets increase the intensity of a workout by overloading a muscle group and pushing it to its limit to burn fat and boost the cardiorespiratory response.”</p>

<h3>Slow Descent</h3>
<p>The slow descent is essential when doing your workout, your movement becomes slow-mo. It helps to concentrate the muscle group to help with growth, at first the weight you usually use will be heavier than normal on those last reps, so I consider you to go a little lower. For example, a dumbbell slowly go up and slowly go down.</p>

<h3>Pause</h3>
<p>The pause is pausing in the middle of your rep. This put an amount of extension and pressure on the muscle group to help with the strength of the muscle. Set your pause before the explosion of your exercise. For example, when doing squats, go down, pause, and go back up. When doing curls, start-up go down, pause, and bring it back up. Usually, the pause should be 2-3 seconds.</p>

<h3>Mix and match</h3>
<p>Switch up the workouts. If you’re a fan of every exercise, your body weight, and weight workouts together, maybe take different splits and put them together. It’s up to your imagination.</p>
